# Real-Time Asset (RTA) Smart Contract Suite

A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for real-time event creation, curation, tipping, and NFT ownership transfer on SEI network.

## Architecture Overview

The RTA platform consists of six core smart contracts that work together to enable decentralized event management with delegation patterns, real-time tipping, and automated fund distribution.

## Contract Descriptions

### 1. EventFactory (Non-upgradeable)
**Location**: `src/EventFactory.sol`

The central registry and ERC721 NFT contract. Each event is an NFT that can be transferred.

**Key Features**:
- ERC721 NFT minting for events
- Event metadata storage (URI, category, reserve price, duration)
- TicketKiosk deployment per event using CREATE2
- Integration with LiveTipping and Distributor contracts
- Finalization logic with reserve price validation and NFT transfer

**Core Functions**:
- `createEvent()` - Create new RTA NFT event
- `createEventForCreator()` - Create event on behalf of another address
- `setMetadataURI()` - Update event metadata (EventManager only)
- `setReservePrice()` - Update reserve price (EventManager only)
- `finalizeAndTransfer()` - Finalize event and transfer NFT to highest tipper

### 2. EventManager (Upgradeable)
**Location**: `src/EventManager.sol`

Manages post-creation operations and delegation patterns.

**Key Features**:
- Delegation proxy creation using OpenZeppelin Clones
- Permission management for metadata updates
- Event finalization orchestration
- Creator and delegatee authorization

**Core Functions**:
- `createDelegationProxy()` - Deploy delegation proxy for event
- `updateMetadata()` - Update event metadata with authorization checks
- `updateReservePrice()` - Update reserve price with validation
- `finalizeRTA()` - Trigger event finalization process
- `updateDelegate()` - Change delegated address for event

### 3. LiveTipping (Upgradeable)
**Location**: `src/LiveTipping.sol`

Handles real-time tipping during events with automatic highest tipper tracking.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time tip collection with message support
- Automatic highest tipper determination
- Event timing validation (start/end dates)
- Tip aggregation and history tracking

**Core Functions**:
- `sendTip()` - Send tip with message during event
- `getTotalTips()` - Get total tips for event
- `getHighestTipper()` - Get address of highest tipper
- `finalizeEvent()` - Mark event as finalized (creator only)

### 4. Distributor (Upgradeable)
**Location**: `src/Distributor.sol`

Manages fund distribution with configurable curation fees.

**Key Features**:
- 80% creator / 20% treasury base distribution
- Configurable curation fees (0-10% from treasury portion)
- Three curation scopes: Scope 1 (<3%), Scope 2 (3-6%), Scope 3 (6%+)
- Whitelisted curator system

**Core Functions**:
- `distributeTips()` - Distribute funds according to configuration
- `enableCuration()` - Enable curation for event (whitelisted curator only)
- `whitelistCurator()` - Add curator to whitelist (owner only)

### 5. Delegation (Proxy Implementation)
**Location**: `src/Delegation.sol`

Minimal proxy implementation for delegation records.

**Key Features**:
- Immutable delegation relationship storage
- Gas-efficient proxy pattern
- Event-specific delegation tracking

### 6. CreationWrapper (Utility)
**Location**: `src/CreationWrapper.sol`

Utility contract for atomic event creation with delegation setup.

**Key Features**:
- Single transaction event creation + delegation
- Improved user experience
- Gas optimization for common workflow

## Delegation Patterns

### Authorization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User/Creator
    participant CW as CreationWrapper
    participant EF as EventFactory
    participant EM as EventManager
    participant D as Delegation Proxy

    U->>CW: createEventAndDelegate()
    CW->>EF: createEventForCreator()
    EF-->>CW: eventId
    CW->>EM: createDelegationProxyForUser()
    EM->>D: deploy proxy via Clones
    D-->>EM: proxy address
    EM-->>CW: delegation setup complete
    CW-->>U: event created with delegation

    Note over U,D: Delegatee can now modify event
    
    participant Del as Delegatee
    Del->>EM: updateMetadata()
    EM->>EM: check authorization (creator OR delegatee)
    EM->>EF: setMetadataURI()
    EF-->>Del: metadata updated
```

### Metadata Modification Rights

The following metadata fields can be modified through the delegation system:

1. **Metadata URI** (`metadataURI`) - Complete event description, images, details
2. **Reserve Price** (`reservePrice`) - Minimum tip amount required for NFT transfer

**Restrictions**:
- Only before event starts (for reserve price)
- Only before finalization (for metadata)
- Only by creator or authorized delegatee

## Fund Distribution Logic

### Distribution Flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    Start([Event Ends]) --> Check{Reserve Price<br/>Met?}
    Check -->|No| NoTransfer[NFT stays with creator<br/>No distribution]
    Check -->|Yes| Transfer[Transfer NFT to<br/>highest tipper]
    
    Transfer --> Distribute[Distribute Tips]
    
    Distribute --> Creator[Creator: 80%]
    Distribute --> Treasury[Treasury: 20%]
    
    Treasury --> CurationCheck{Curation<br/>Enabled?}
    CurationCheck -->|No| TreasuryFull[Treasury gets full 20%]
    CurationCheck -->|Yes| CurationSplit[Curator: 0-10%<br/>Treasury: 10-20%]
    
    NoTransfer --> End([Process Complete])
    TreasuryFull --> End
    CurationSplit --> End
```

### Curation Scopes

| Scope | Fee Range | Services |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Scope 1** | < 3% | Basic curation (description, schedule, banner) |
| **Scope 2** | 3-6% | Advanced curation (promotion, social media) |
| **Scope 3** | 6%+ | Premium curation (video enhancement, highlights) |

## Event Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: createEvent()
    Created --> Delegated: createDelegationProxy()
    Created --> Active: Event starts
    Delegated --> Active: Event starts
    
    Active --> Tipping: sendTip()
    Tipping --> Tipping: More tips
    Tipping --> Ended: Event duration expires
    
    state Ended {
        [*] --> ReserveCheck: finalizeRTA()
        ReserveCheck --> ReserveMet: Tips >= Reserve Price
        ReserveCheck --> ReserveNotMet: Tips < Reserve Price
        
        ReserveMet --> NFTTransfer: Transfer to highest tipper
        ReserveNotMet --> NoTransfer: NFT stays with creator
        
        NFTTransfer --> FundDistribution
        NoTransfer --> [*]
        FundDistribution --> [*]
    }
    
    Ended --> [*]
```

## Key Features Validated by Tests

## Core Interaction Patterns

### For Event Creators

```solidity
// 1. Create event with delegation in one transaction
creationWrapper.createEventAndDelegate(
    startDate,
    duration,
    reservePrice,
    metadataURI,
    category,
    ticketsAmount,
    ticketPrice,
    delegateeAddress
);

// 2. Update metadata (creator or delegatee)
eventManager.updateMetadata(eventId, newMetadataURI);

// 3. Finalize event after it ends
eventManager.finalizeRTA(eventId);
```

### For Tippers

```solidity
// Send tip during event
liveTipping.sendTip{value: tipAmount}(eventId, "Great performance!");

// Check highest tipper
address highest = liveTipping.getHighestTipper(eventId);
uint256 total = liveTipping.getTotalTips(eventId);
```

### For Fund Distribution

```solidity
// Distribute collected tips
distributor.distributeTips{value: totalTipAmount}(eventId);

// Enable curation (whitelisted curator only)
distributor.enableCuration(eventId, 300, CurationScope.SCOPE_2); // 3%
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: All metadata modifications require creator or delegatee authorization
2. **Timing Constraints**: Reserve price cannot be modified after event starts
3. **Finalization Safety**: Events can only be finalized once and only after proper validation
4. **Fund Security**: All fund transfers use secure patterns with reentrancy protection
5. **Upgrade Safety**: Upgradeable contracts use UUPS pattern with proper authorization

## Gas Optimization

- Uses OpenZeppelin Clones for delegation proxies (minimal proxy pattern)
- CREATE2 for deterministic TicketKiosk addresses
- Efficient storage patterns and custom errors
- Batch operations where possible

## Integration

The contract suite integrates with:
- Frontend React application for user interactions
- XMTP for messaging
- The Graph for event indexing
- SEI blockchain for fast, low-cost transactions

For detailed integration examples, see the `/haus` frontend application.
